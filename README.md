# Weather Dashboard

## Summary

The Weather Dashboard is deployed and ready to help plan your trips.

### Webpage

* Searching for valid city names pops up current conditions and a five-day forecast.

* Forecasts contain the date, weather icons, temperature, wind, and humidity.

* Clicking on saved city name buttons will search for conditions and forecast for that city.

* Saved city name buttons are saved in localStorage and will persist on page refresh.

### Code

* Most page content is not in the HTML. It is generated dynamically.

* I used Bootstrap, dayJS, and jQuery APIs.

* I also used the openweathermap.org API to retrieve weather data.

* A small CSS file makes changes that I could not figure out how to do in Bootstrap.

* Descriptive comments added to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
